            <h4>Early Life & Education</h4>
            <p>
              Trevor Noah was born on 20 February 1984, in Johannesburg, Transvaal (now Gauteng), South Africa. His
              father,
              Robert, is Swiss-German, and his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is Xhosa.
              
              Under apartheid legislation, Noah's mother was classified as Black, and his father was classified as
              White. Noah himself
              was classified as Coloured. At the time of his birth, his parents' interracial relationship was illegal,
              which Noah
              highlights in his autobiography. Interracial sexual relations and marriages were decriminalised a year
              after his birth,
              when the Immorality Act was amended in 1985. Patricia and her mother, Nomalizo Frances Noah, raised Trevor
              in the black
              township of Soweto. Noah began his schooling at Maryvale College, a private Roman Catholic primary and
              high school
              in Maryvale, Gauteng, a suburb of Johannesburg.

            <h4>Career</h4>
            <p>
              In 2002, Noah made a brief appearance on the South African soap opera Isidingo. He later hosted his own
              radio show
              called Noah's Ark on YFM, a popular youth radio station in Gauteng. At the age of 21, he took up a dare
              from his friends
              to perform a comedy routine at a nightclub. His performance, filled with humorous stories about his life
              and friends,
              was well-received, and he continued to perform at comedy clubs, gaining recognition in the process. He
              decided to focus
              on comedy, leaving his radio show and acting behind. Along the way, he performed with various South
              African and
              international comedians, including David Kau, Gabriel Iglesias, and Russell Peters.

              Noah also ventured into television hosting. He hosted several shows in South Africa, such as Run the
              Adventure, The Real
              Goboza, and Siyadlala. He also co-hosted The Amazing Date and participated as a contestant in Strictly
              Come Dancing.
              Additionally, he hosted award shows like the South Africa Film and Television Awards and the South African
              Music Awards.
              Noah became a spokesperson for Cell C, a major mobile phone network provider in South Africa.

              His stand-up comedy performances included appearances in The Blacks Only Comedy Show, the Heavyweight
              Comedy Jam, and
              various comedy festivals. He released several stand-up comedy specials in South Africa, including The
              Daywalker, Crazy
              Normal, That's Racist, and It's My Culture.

              In 2011, he moved to the United States and made history as the first South African stand-up comedian to
              appear on The
              Tonight Show and Late Show with David Letterman. He was the subject of the documentary You Laugh But It's
              True and
              starred in the one-man comedy show Trevor Noah: The Racist. He also served as the Roastmaster in a Comedy
              Central Roast
              and appeared in comedy panel shows like QI and 8 Out of 10 Cats.

              Noah's career took a major turn when he joined The Daily Show as a recurring contributor in 2014. In 2015,
              he succeeded
              Jon Stewart as the host of the show. While his tenure as host initially faced some criticism and a decline
              in
              viewership, Comedy Central stood behind him, emphasizing his talent and the show's popularity among
              millennials.

              In addition to his work on The Daily Show, Noah developed and produced other shows, including The
              Opposition with Jordan
              Klepper and the docuseries Klepper. He also signed a multiyear contract with Viacom and launched his own
              production
              company called Day Zero Productions.

              Noah has been known for making controversial statements and jokes, such as his comments about the French
              national
              football team and his tweets that were criticized as being misogynistic or mocking certain groups. These
              incidents have
              sparked debates and discussions about his comedic style and the boundaries of humor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from his television career, Noah has written a memoir called Born a Crime, which received positive
              reviews and
              became a bestseller. A film adaptation of the book starring Lupita Nyong'o as his mother was announced. He
              also
              co-authored a book titled The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library, featuring a collection of
